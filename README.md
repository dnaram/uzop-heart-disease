## 2. MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS FOR HEART DISEASE PREDICTION
- main idea behind this discussion is to put stress on how helpful machine learning approaches are to predict the heart disease using medical data
- this section described the comprehensive overview on the previous work accompanied to predict the heart disease in a patient using ML approaches
- the idea of this study is to improve the previous work using the selected dataset and ML models, as described in the next section
- he most commonly ML approaches found and used in this study are; Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression

## 3. DATA OVERVIEW
-  The dataset used in this research is collected from Kaggle platform, the dataset is also known as Heart Disease Dataset
- attributes: Age, Sex, CP, RestBP, Chol, FBS, RestECG, HeatBeat, Exang,  OldPeak, Slope, CA, Thal, **Target** (0,1)

## 4. DATA PREPROCESSING
- In this study, multiple preprocessing steps applied on the selected dataset:
	- for each attribute using minimum and maximum values, the random number generation technique applied to generate random values for each column => In conclusion, the data have increased the volume by three times
	- using rapid miner, data cleaning step applied to find out missing values and noisy data values
	- The next step was to transform the data values into appropriate data type

## 5. THE EXPERIMENT PREPARATION
- This research used five different models to predict the heart disease using collected dataset
- Algorithm: predicting heart failure disease
	- 1. selection of dataset/data preprocessing
	- 2. model selection
	- 3. model implementation using Rapid Miner
	- 4. preformance measurement
	- 5. result comparison
- A. Decision Tree
- B. Naive Bayes
- C. Random Forest
- D. Logistic Regression
- E. SVM 

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION
- This research used five machine learning models, using predictive approach to forecast the chances of heart failure in a patient admitted in the hospitals
- At the first step of implementation, the training dataset used to learn the ML model. For this, the dataset was imported using ― "Read_CSV" operator in Rapid Miner
